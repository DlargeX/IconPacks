- **Download:**  Click on the image of the Icon Pack you want.  
- **Installation:**
  1) Extract the contents of the archive.  
  2) Navigate to that location and you should see a new `IconPacks-*` folder.
  3) Move the contents inside of the folder into `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/` (on Classic use `_classic_era_` | on TBC use `_classic_`).
- **How should look after?**
  1) The icons should be inside of `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/ICONS/`.  
  2) With the expection of the `INV_OrderHall_*.blp` files. Those should be inside of the Interface folder with the `ICONS` folder.
- **Known issues:**  Might glitch equipment manager icons. That part of UI doesn't support icon replacements.
