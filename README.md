> Download:  Click on the image of the Icon Pack you want.
> Installation:  Extract the contents of the archive.
   Navigate to that location and you should see a new "interface-*" folder.
   Move the contents inside of the folder into "World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\".
> How should look after?  The icons should be inside of "World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\ICONS\".
   With the expection of the "INV_OrderHall_*.blp" files. Those should be inside of the Interface folder with the ICONS folder.
> Known issues:  Might glitch equipment manager icons. That part of UI doesn't support icon replacements.
